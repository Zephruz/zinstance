# zinstance
Being able to hop to a different instance/world - instantly; all within the same server.

zinstance brings something that seemingly has never been done within Garrys Mod; you can be on the same server as your friend but, you can't hear, see, or even interact with them in any way.
That is the idea of instancing, being able to play in a different dimension of the same server while still playing the core aspect of the gamemode.

Instancing may be a difficult concept to grasp. 
Thinking of it in the most simple way, have you ever played Counter Strike? If you have, imagine having multiple games on the same server/map but still keeping the core aspect of separate games. You can only see what your game permits you to.
